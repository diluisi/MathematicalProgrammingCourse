Since we have not found an optimal solution yet, we need to choose which node to further explore in the following step. The bounds from node $2$ tell us that we already have a feasible solution whose value is $16$. Also, the best we will have from further exploring node $2$ is a solution of value $20$. On the other hand, from node $3$ we have a feasible solution of value $12$ and the best we will get in further exploring is $16$.
